# DeepTag dataset - noise part

## File structure
Folder names are in the format of `imgs_0ABC`, where
- "A" is the marker family, and 0~6 represents AprilTag, ArUco, ARToolKitPlus, TopoTag, AprilTag-XO, AprilTag-XA and RuneTag(+) respectively.
- "B" is the view angle, and 0~9 represents 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 65, 70, and 75 deg respectively.
- "C" is the view distance, and 0~9 represents 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 cm respectively.

Each folder contains images of the same marker, view distance, and view angle, but different noise levels.
Image file names are in the format of `DDDD_EEEEEE`, where
- "DDDD" represents noise level, and the standard deviation (STD) of Gassian noise is `DDDD * 5`, e.g., "0005" represents `STD = 25`.
- For each noise level, there are 10 randomly generated images, and "EEEEEE" is the image index.
